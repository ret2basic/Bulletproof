# Prove you know the inner product of a and b using a combination of the algorithm from Chapter 5 and Chapter 7.
# Your interactive proof should transmit no more than logarithmic size data and be zero knowledge even if n = 1.
# Use a random elliptic curve basis based on the algorithm from Chapter 1.
